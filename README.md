Pong

About
-----

This is a version of Pong I wrote in VB when I was 14 / 15. The aim was that it would run on school computers to relieve the tedium of our IT lessons (which it did!)

Controls
--------

The left-hand paddle responds to A and Z, the right-hand responds to K and M.

Note
----

No idea if it works on more recent OS versions as I don't have any computers with Windows on any more, but I'm hoping it might be useful to someone or at least bring back some VB nostalgia :)
